PURPOSE:

[
	The program creates a server and a client. A menu is created 
	for them to allow communication between the client and the server. 
	The server is multi-threaded to allow multiple clients to have access to the server.
	The threads are borrowed from a thread pool and are run by the server to handle clients.
	The server main thread constantly checks for any incoming clients trying to connect to the server.
